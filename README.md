Rent Wheels is a responsive front-end web application designed for an online vehicle rental platform. It provides users with an intuitive interface to browse and select from a wide range of rental vehicles, including bikes, cars, sedans, vans, buses, and trucks.

The homepage features a navigation bar with quick access to user authentication (Sign Up/Login), bookings, and order cancellation pages. Each vehicle category is visually represented with clickable sections that lead to detailed listings. The site includes a search bar, notification icon, and a structured footer with company information and support links.

The project is built entirely with HTML and CSS, using Font Awesome for icons and Google Fonts for stylish typography. Firebase has been configured for analytics and is ready for integration with backend services like Firestore and authentication.

This project aims to simulate the look and feel of a real-world rental platform and can be extended with backend functionalities like real-time bookings, user account management, and payment integration. It serves as a strong foundation for building a fully functional vehicle rental web application.

Clean and modern UI design

Category-based vehicle browsing
